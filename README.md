## Hi there 👋

- 🧙‍♂️ I’m currently working on my own AI startup company that uses generates Dungeons & Dragons adventures, campaigns and worlds. These tasks typically take 4 hours or more, are difficult to maintain without extensive notes, and are required for playing Dungeons & Dragons. With [Roleplay Rev](https://www.roleplayrev.com) you can create D&D content about whatever you want instantly, without worrying about balance or consistency.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to structure complex projects to be able to push new features easily over the long term. Highly recommend [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_1/132-2695155-3570120?pd_rd_w=ddwAO&content-id=amzn1.sym.04064661-569a-4d64-8aef-6cc4eefc1253&pf_rd_p=04064661-569a-4d64-8aef-6cc4eefc1253&pf_rd_r=6QEGXBX5SYN3NGAYPTJC&pd_rd_wg=6C8hI&pd_rd_r=a24397cd-07bd-4c76-b6b6-6f29eceb75b1&pd_rd_i=0321125215&psc=1) by Eric Evans.
- ✨ I'm looking to collaborate on a large startup enterprise that is pushing boundaries, especially in the generative AI space. I have learned what I can in a solo environment, and want to bring those skills to a larger and rapidly evolving project.
